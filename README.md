# Newlib: stdlib implementation for Proteus

## Requirements

The prerequisites and the installation process for using the Newlib library is
detailed in the [README of Proteus](https://github.com/proteus-core/proteus/README.md#building-software).

## Building the example

The Makefile can generate `ihex` (`make ihex`) and `bin` (`make bin`) files for running in different simulation contexts. Simply running `make` generates both of these (and an `elf` binary).
